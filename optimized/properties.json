On the inside, oil painted and stone made ceilings welcome you. Kitchen, dining and living room merge into a 140m2 space, fully covered in 1st quality marble. On the upper level, a 2-walk-in closet master bedroom, equipped with its own bathroom/jacuzzi and balcony, and 3 more spacious bedrooms, all with their own walkin closets, will form the resting area.

This incredible place gets its hot water from a solar system device, which can properly supply the entire house.
